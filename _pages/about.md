I am a postdoctoral scholar at UC Berkeley and a research scientist at Facebook AI Research. I work on state abstractions, model-based reinforcement learning, representation learning, and generalization in RL. I did my PhD at McGill University and Mila - Quebec AI Institute, co-supervised by Joelle Pineau and Doina Precup. I also have an M.Eng. in EECS and dual B.Sci. degrees in Mathematics and EECS from MIT.
